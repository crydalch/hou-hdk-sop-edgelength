= Edge Length =

""" Set length of edges in arbitrary positions. """

Modify length of edges in arbitrary positions. If selection contain multiple edge islands, modification will be applied to each separately.

There are two selection types that node supports:
- single edge selections
- multi edge selection with one common point

If any other selection will be found, node will ignore it, apply effect to proper ones, and add warning to inform user that selection contains also other types of edge islands that are not supported by this node.

Examples:

- example single edges selection

- example multi edge selection with one point

- example of multi edge selection that contains also closed selection

@parameters

== Filter ==

[Include:parameters--group#edgegroupinput0]

Process Mode:
	#id: processmode
	Specify edge process mode.
	
	Single:
		#id: 0 
		Use only single, not connected edges.		
	Multi:
		#id: 1
		Use only edges connected with one common point.		
	Mixed:
		#id: 2
		Single and Multi mode together.

== Main ==
	
Length Mode:
	#id: lengthmode
	Length calculation method.
	
	Override:
		#id: 0
		Use existing edge length and add/substract from it. Uses world units.		
	Percentage:
		#id: 1
		How many percent of current edge length you want to use.		
	Custom:
		#id: 2
		Specify custom length. Uses world units.
	
-/+:
	#id: lengthoverridevalue
	Visible only when _Length Mode_ is set to _Override_ mode.
		
%:
	#id: lengtpercentagevalue
	Visible only when _Length Mode_ is set to _Percentage_ mode.

Value:
	#id: lengtcustomvalue
	Visible only when _Length Mode_ is set to _Custom_ mode.
	
Start From:
		#id: startfrom
		Specify in direction of modification. This parameter is applicable only to single edges.
		
		Smaller Number:
			#id: 0
			Use point with smaller number as starting point and apply modification towards bigger number.
			
		Bigger Number:
			#id: 1
			Use point with bigger number as starting point and apply modification towards smaller number.
			
		Averanged:
			#id: 2
			Find center of edge and apply modifification away from it towards each edge point.
			
		Closest To Position:
			#id: 3
			Find which point is closest to specified position and use it as start.

		Farthest To Position:
			#id: 4
			Find which point is farthest from specified position and use it as start.
			
Position:
	#id: positionpoint
	Position used and visible only in _Start From_ parameter _Closest To Position_ and _Farthest To Position_ modes.
